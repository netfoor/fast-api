What is venv?

`venv` is a module in Python that allows you to create isolated environments for your projects. This is useful for managing dependencies and ensuring that your project has access to the correct versions of libraries without interfering with other projects on your system. When you create a virtual environment using `venv`, it creates a directory that contains a copy of the Python interpreter and a local `site-packages` directory where you can install packages specific to that environment.

Creating a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment using `venv`, you can use the following command:

```
python -m venv myenv
```

This will create a new directory called `myenv` (you can choose any name you like) that contains the virtual environment.
